# ðŸ’§ Statistical Analysis of Water Potability

## Overview  
This project explores chemical differences between potable and non-potable water sources using statistical analysis on a dataset of 3,276 global water samples. The analysis focuses on comparing key water quality metrics (pH, conductivity) and assessing their relationship to drinkability.

---

## Key Findings  
- No statistically significant differences found in pH or conductivity between potable and non-potable sources  
- Mean pH: 7.074 (non-potable) vs. 7.085 (potable)  
- Mean conductivity: 426.5 vs. 427.4  
- Trends support research linking lower conductivity and acidic pH with higher potability  

---

## Methods Used  
- Welchâ€™s t-tests and ANOVA  
- Bootstrap and asymptotic confidence intervals  
- Data visualization with `ggplot2` and `Matplotlib`

---

## Technologies  
- **R**: ggplot2, stats  
- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib  
- **JupyterLab**  
- **RStudio**

---

## Interpretation  
Although no significant statistical differences were observed, the analysis suggests potential directional patterns worth exploring with expanded data (e.g., region-specific or additional chemical variables).
